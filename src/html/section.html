        I attached a link to
        <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm"
          >Yellowstone National Park</a
        >
        here, and my code has replaced it with this blurb.

        This is an attachment section. We can detect when specific files or URLs
        are attached to cards, and replace the attachments with any content we
        want.

        <li>
          <iframe
            width="560"
            height="315"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hY7m5jjJ9mM"
            title="YouTube video player"
            frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
            allowfullscreen
          ></iframe>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Weirdly, using attachment sections removes the ability to just open the
        attachment. You must
        <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm" target="_blank"
          >add a link</a
        >
        to get that back.
