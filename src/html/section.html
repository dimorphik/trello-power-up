        I attached a link to
        <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm"
          >Yellowstone National Park</a
        >
        here, and my code has replaced it with this blurb.

        Hello, Sony friends. This is an attachment section. When Trello detects
        a specific file or URL attached to a card, we can make it add any
        content we like.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>For example, here are some cats:</li>
        <li>
          <iframe
            width="560"
            height="315"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hY7m5jjJ9mM"
            title="YouTube video player"
            frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
            allowfullscreen
          ></iframe>
        </li>
      </ol>

        Weirdly, this removes the ability to just open the attachment. You have
        to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/index.htm">add a link</a> to get
        that back.
